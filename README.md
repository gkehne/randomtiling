# randomtiling

This program creates a square window of specified size into a tiling of the plane by 1x2 (and, less reliably, 1x3, 1x4, etc.) blocks. it does this by randomly choosing which block to place next on any empty spaces on a diagonal, which sweeps from one corner of the square to the other. 

Here is a sample output using 1x2 blocks: ![randomly generated 2-tiling](https://github.com/gkehne/randomtiling/blob/master/random2tiling.jpg?raw=true)
